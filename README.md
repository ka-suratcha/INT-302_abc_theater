# INT-302_abc_theater

## ðŸ“– Overview
This project was created as part of the INT-301 course assignment.  

The goal is to use the **database system** that you learned in class and in labs, along with the **website development** that you learned in ITE-301. This is because the same professorÂ taught both classes and wanted us to put them together into one project.  

I decided to build a **movie booking system** because it is a useful example that needs both database management and web interaction.  It lets me to practice designing relational tables (for users, movies, and bookings) and also apply my PHP/MySQL web development skills to create a system that members and admins can use.
